# CryptoClustering: Unveiling Cryptocurrency Market Patterns

In this module, we'll leverage Python and unsupervised learning techniques to predict the impact of 24-hour or 7-day price changes on various cryptocurrencies.

**Initial Data Exploration:**
- We start by loading the 'crypto_market_data.csv' file into a DataFrame.
- Then, we'll obtain summary statistics and plot the data to better understand its structure.

**Preparing the Data:**
- Next, we'll normalize the data using the StandardScaler() module from scikit-learn.
- We'll create a DataFrame with the scaled data, setting the "coin_id" index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame.

**Finding the Optimal K-value:**
- Using the elbow method, we'll determine the best value for k (number of clusters) using the original scaled DataFrame.
- By creating a line chart with inertia values computed for different values of k, we'll visually identify the optimal value.

**Clustering with K-means:**
- We'll then cluster the cryptocurrencies using the K-means algorithm and the determined optimal k-value.
- By visualizing the scatter plot with the data points colored by their respective labels, we'll gain insights into the groupings.

**Optimizing Clusters with Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**
- Performing PCA on the original scaled DataFrame, we'll reduce the features to three principal components.
- By analyzing the explained variance, we'll understand the information attributed to each principal component.

**Refining K-value using PCA Data:**
- We'll use the elbow method again, this time on the PCA data, to find the best value for k.
- Comparing the results with those obtained from the original data will help us gauge the impact of feature reduction.

**Cluster Analysis with Reduced Features:**
- Finally, we'll cluster the cryptocurrencies using the K-means algorithm on the PCA data.
- By visualizing the scatter plot, we can assess the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-means.

Let's dive into the analysis and unlock the patterns hidden within the cryptocurrency market data.
